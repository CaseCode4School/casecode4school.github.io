    <h1>About ME</h1>
    <h2>Case Montgomery</h2>
    <h3>(no nicknames, just casenames)</h3>
    <p>I'm a Computer Science Major Sophomore trying to figure out the changes made to the program since COVID.
      Currently, I'm taking three 400 level classes and two level 100; the difference in pacing is interesting.</p>
    <p>I like tinkering and learning new stuff. Reading's fun too. I don't have grandchildren (not sure why that's a
      question), though I suppose I'm technically old enough to have them, but let's not get into that. </p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church since I was 8 and a little. I don't have a singular instance of scripture spoken
      or written I would profess as being my favorite, but I do have a few speakers I connect with better than others.
    </p>
    <p>I suppose I would like to also share this screenshot to get credit. I've some experience in HTML, just not HTML
      5. It's mostly the same though, so I can help some.</p>
